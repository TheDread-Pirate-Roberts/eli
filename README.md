### steps you only need to setup this program (copy everything inside the backticks and paste into terminal)
`bundle`
Pay attention to the output you may need to `gem install bundler`

## How to run the program
`ruby fizz_buzz.rb`

## How to test
`rspec fizz_buzz_spec.rb`

#### The challenge
You'll need to write some ruby code that iterates over numbers 100 through 1. 
 
Every time a number is evenly divisible by 3 you'll print ("puts" https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_input_output.htm) the word "fizz"

Every time a number is evenly divisble by 5 you'll print "buzz"

and if a number is evenly divisble by 3 and 5 you'll print "fizzbuzz"
